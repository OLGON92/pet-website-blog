  <h1>A sequel to my Marley blog.</h1>
  <h2>His name is <Strong>Ziggy</Strong>.</h2>

  <p>Ziggy was a kitten when my mother rescued him from a hoarder's house. He was such an adorable little cat. He, like most cats, was also a bit of a jerk, but I loved him all the same. He used to climb on my shoulder when he was a kitten. He has really mellowed out since his days as a kitten; which makes glad because--boy-- he was a wild one.</p>

<p>Here are a list of things he <em>enjoys</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sleeping</li>
  <li>Eating</li>
  <li>Running around at 2AM</li>
  <li>Treats</li>
  <li>Standing in front of the heater</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>
