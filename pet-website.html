  <h1>A blog about one of my cats</h1>
  <h2>His name is <strong>Marley</strong></h2>

  <p>I found Marley on the side of a gas station somewhere in Northern California; he was a kitten at the time. I was with my mother at the time, and we were on our way to see my friend Collin and his mom in Portland. I can remember my mother and I hearing his meows. I innitially did not want to intervene as I had assumed that the mama cat was going to come back for him. My mother thought otherwise because he was by himself instead of being with his brothers or sisters. We went to catch him with the intention of taking him to the nearest ASPCA or shelter; he darted for the freeway as we were making our approach. Thankfully, I snatched him before he could get there. We did not end up taking him to a shelter, and he has been with my family ever since.</p>

  <p> Here are a few of the things he <em>enjoys</em>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sleeping</li>
    <li>Looking out the window</li>
    <li>Eating</li>
    <li>Being a bit of a menace</li>
    <li>Kneading</li>
  </ul>
